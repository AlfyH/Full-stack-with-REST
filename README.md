This project is to build a full stack application.
Author: Alfy Hushairi
Current personal website (not this one): [https://alfyhushairi.com/](https://alfyhushairi.com/)

## Approach
- Use JavaScript and JSX to build out the components for the application in a modular fashion.
- Use React Router to set up the routes.
- Use the Fetch API or a tool like Axios to fetch data from the REST API.
- Allow users to sign up and use basic authentication to support users signing in.

## Tools to be used
React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.

## To-do
- This will eventually evolve into my portfolio website
